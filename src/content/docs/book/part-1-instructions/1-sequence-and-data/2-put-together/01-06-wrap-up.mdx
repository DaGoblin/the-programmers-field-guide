Hopefully this has helped you see how you can put the concepts from this chapter to work. The main thing is to think about is what you want to achieve, and working out the small steps that you will need the computer to perform. Once you have this basic outline of the process in mind, you can identify the variables and constants you will need so that you need to have all the information somewhere in the code for you to use. With this more complete plan, you can use the syntax of the programming language to help you convert your ideas into code.
Remember at every stage of the process that the computer is unintelligent, and will do exactly and only what you tell it to do.

If you get stuck, the [wrap up](../../5-wrap-up/1-change) section includes a working version of this program's code. Make sure you have a go at coding the change calculator yourself, and avoid using tools like GitHub Copilot for the moment. These tools can help generate code for you, but you want to know how to do this yourself first. Similarly, copying the code that is provided won't help you understand how to write it yourself. Even just the practice of typing it in will help you think through each of the steps.

Next let's have a look at a couple of extra example programs. These will help you see and practice the programming process.
