Hopefully this has helped you see how you can put the concepts from this chapter to work. The main thing is to think about what you want to achieve, and work out the small steps that you will need the computer to perform to achieve this. Once you have this basic outline of the process in mind, you can identify the variables and constants you will need to achieve this, remembering that the computer is unintelligent, so you need to have all the information somewhere in the code for you to use. With this more complete plan, you can use the syntax of the programming language to help you convert your ideas into code the programming language tools can use.

If you get stuck, the [wrap up](../../5-wrap-up/1-change) section includes a working version of this programs code. Make sure you had a go at coding the change calculator yourself, and avoid using tools like GitHub Copilot for the moment. These tools can help generate code for you, but you want to know how to do this yourself first. Similarly, copying the code that is provided won't help you understand how to do this yourself. Even just the practice of typing this in yourself will help you think through each of these steps.

Next let's have a look at a couple of extra example programs. These will help you see and practice the programming process.
