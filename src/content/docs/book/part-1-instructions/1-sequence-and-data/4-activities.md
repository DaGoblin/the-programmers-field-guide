Having explored this leg of the journey you are now approaching a rest stop and a chance to practice and reflect.

## Test Your Knowledge

The following activities describe a program that you can create using the concepts we have learnt so far. Use these to validate that you have developed the knowledge and skills needed to create programs that involve sequence and data.

As you work through this, you need to draw together several aspects important to programming. Focus on the **programming process and tools**, building your program in several iterations that involve you understanding, designing, implementing, and testing your program. Focus on **syntax** as you memorise the syntax for the different instructions, and pick up some methods you can use in the libraries we are using. Lastly, focus on the **programming concepts** associated with the instructions, building blocks, and terminology developed through this chapter. In particular, focus on the idea of sequence, the use of variable, constant, data types, and method call building blocks, and the terminology for expressions and literals.

### Unit Converter

Here we will be putting together everything we learnt across this chapter into something that might help us -- a unit converter!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program that takes in a number of millimeters, and converts them into metric units such as centimeters, meters, and kilometers, as well as imperial units such as inches, feet, and miles.

For your reference:

- There are 10 millimeters in a centimeter.
- There are 100 centimeters in a meter.
- There are 1000 meters in a kilometer.
- There are 25.4 millimeters in an inch.
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Your program should:

- Ask the user how many millimeters they would like to convert.
- Return the resultant conversions for both metric and imperial units, from the largest to the smallest denomination.

### Sound Player

Here we will be trying out some SplashKit functionality and playing a song (or part thereof) back to us!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program which will ask the user where a sound file is located, the name of that sound file, as well as what timestamp the sound is to start playing, and for how long.

You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [playing music in SplashKit](./1-concepts/11-graphics#playing-music) for this task.

Your program should:

- Ask the user the file path of the folder the song is located in (e.g: C:/Users/Desktop/Songs/).
- Ask the user the file name of the song.
- Ask the user what timestamp they would like the song to start at (e.g: 00:45 for 45 seconds into the song).
- Ask the user how long they would like the song to play for in seconds.
- Play the section of the song the user asked for.

### Game Splash Screen

Here we will be creating the beginning of any good game; a splash-screen/title animation!

In this task, it is up to you to create a short sequence of SplashKit events, such as shapes, colours, and delays to act as an introduction or title animation to a game.

You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [drawing in SplashKit](./1-concepts/11-graphics#drawing-to-a-window) for this task.

Your program should:

- Welcome the user to the game with an appropriate title.
- Play an introductory animation using shapes, colors, and delays.
