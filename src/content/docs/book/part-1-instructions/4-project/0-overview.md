We are now at a point where we have seen the concepts and practices for instructing the computer. The focus has been on the different instructions, how they work within the computer, and how we can start to put these together in order to create small programs.

To wrap up this part of the journey, we will stop and look in more detail at putting these concepts in to action. The goal of this chapter is to bring together the details we have seen say far, and use these to build a small program.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this section you should be able to:

- Plan out small algorithms
- Explain factors that go into making code easy to read
- Make effective use of your editor
