## Test Your Knowledge

### Task 1 - Petrol Price Information

Here we will be creating some useful information based on petrol prices that the user enters.

In this task, it is up to you to create a program asks the user for how much they paid per litre l the last time they purchased petrol, and then update some useful statistics based on all of the previous prices entered by the user.

Your program should:

- Ask the user how much they paid per litre (in cents) the last time they purchased petrol
- Ask the user how many litres they purchased in the same transaction
- Return the average petrol price that the user has paid for petrol ever (in cents)
- Return the total amount the user has ever paid for petrol (in dollars and cents)
- Repeat all of this until the user quits the application

### Task 2 - Sound Player - Changing the Song

Here we will be expanding upon what we did in the previous activity, and make it so that we can re-enter song information instead of having the program only work once.

In this task, it is up to you to create a program which will ask the user where a sound file is located, the name of that sound file, as well as what timestamp the sound is to start playing, and for how long. On top of this, once the song has finished playing, it should ask if the user wants to either repeat the same song, or re-enter different song information.

You might need the following SplashKit functions:

Your program should:

- Ask the user the file path of the folder the song is located in (e.g: C:/Users/Desktop/Songs/)
- Ask the user the file name of the song
- Ask the user what timestamp they would like the song to start at (e.g: 00:45 for 45 seconds into the song)
- Ask the user how long they would like the song to play for in seconds
- Play the section of the song the user asked for
- Ask the user whether they would like to replay the same sound segment, or re-enter new song information

### Task 3 - Moving a Character around the Screen

Here we will be making it so that the player can move a character around the screen.

In this task, it is up to you to create a looping program that constantly checks for player input to see which direction the player would like to move, and then move the character in the game.

You might need the following SplashKit functions:


Your program should:

- Check to see if the player has input W, A, S, or D, moving Up, Left, Down, or Right respectively
- Move the character across the screen by an appropriate amount
- Either not allow the character to move outside the screen boundaries OR make it so the character teleports to the other side of the screen when it reaches the boundary
