title: "Summary"

This chapter has introduced a number of new instructions that you can use in your code to create more dynamic programs. You now have a range of different instructions that you can put in your toolbelt, and use to help craft the sequence you use to get the computer to perform a desired action.

:::note

- **Building Blocks** are things you can create and use.
- **Terms** are things you need to understand.
- **Instructions** are things you can command the computer to perform.

:::

Putting these together now requires some computational thinking, and give you the tools you need to design algorithms that achieve much more than you could with just simple sequences.
