title: Hand Execution
---

Running code yourself can be a great way to help you understand how a program works. This is useful both for functioning programs, and for when you are thinking through issues that have arisen.

The idea is to read through the code, and "run" it yourself. So you have to act like a computer (remember that the computer is unintelligent!). This should be an entirely mechanical process. Read each line, perform each action as they occur. An example is shown below.

The main thing you will need is a piece of paper to act as your **memory**. The computer is unintelligent, but it can remember values in variables. When you encounter a variable declaration, create a box somewhere on your page to keep track of that variable's value. When you need to know that value of that variable later as the code runs, you can look in that box and read the current value.

With each assignment statement, you need to perform the steps associated: calculate the value of the expression, and store the result in the variable. For the 'store' step, cross out the old value and write in the new one.

:::tip
Start with big boxes for the variables.
You want to make sure you have space for every value the variable is assigned over the execution of the program.

Hand execution is a great way to see if you really understand the actions that each statement performs. Hopefully you have noticed we have been using it a lot to explain how different statements work! As your programs get more complex, you can use hand execution to see how the computer is organising its data. This can be a valuable tool for debugging, but also helpful when initially designing your program's logic.
