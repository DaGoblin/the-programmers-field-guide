title: Hand Execution

Running the code yourself can also be a great way to help you understand how the program works. This is useful both for functioning programs, and for when you are thinking through issues that have arisen.

The idea is to read through the code, and "run" it yourself. So you have to act like a computer - remember that the computer is unintelligent. This should be an entirely mechanical process. Read each line, perform each action as they occur. An example is shown below.

The main thing you will need is a piece of paper to act as you *memory*. Remember the computer is unintelligent, but it can remember values in variables. When you encounter a variable declaration, create a box somewhere on your page to keep track of that variable's value. When you need to know that value of that variable later as the code runs, you can look in that box and read the current value.

With each assignment statement, you need to perform the steps associated with that including calculating the value of the expression and storing the result in the variable. When you store this, cross out the old value and write in the new one.

Start with big boxes for the variables. You want to make sure you have space to store the updates to the variable within the box.

This is a great way to see if you really understand the actions that each statement performs. As your programs get more complex, you can then use this activity to *see* how the computer is organising its data, and you can use this to both design the steps as you create the program and debug the steps when they are not quite working.
