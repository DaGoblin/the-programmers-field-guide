title: Building Your First Program
---

To build your own program you need do:

1. Create a new folder for the project
2. Use `dotnet new console` to create the initial project files
3. Add used packages using `dotnet add package`
4. Write the code in **Program.cs**
5. Build and run using `dotnet run`

You can also run this in the debugger, which will let you step through the program, seeing each instruction in action.

We will go through the steps above in more detail on the next pages.

:::tip
Make sure to **save** your source code files in VS Code before you build and run your project. The tab at the top of the file will show a filled circle at the right of the file name if the file has unsaved changes.
