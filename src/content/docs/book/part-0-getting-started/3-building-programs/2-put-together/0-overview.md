title: Building Your First Program
---

<!-- Note: Flesh out this overview, for what will be included in the next pages (can be more casual/fun for this) -->

To build your own program you need do:

1. Create a new folder for the project
2. Use `dotnet new console` to initialise the project
3. Add used packages using `dotnet add package`
4. Write the code in **Program.cs**
5. Build and run using `dotnet run`

You can also run this in the debugger, which will let you step through the program, seeing each instruction in action.

:::tip
Make sure to **save** your source code files in vscode before you build and run your project. The tab at the top of the file will show a filled circle at the right of the file name if the file has unsaved changes.
