In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary applications and tools on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Ubuntu. This will enable you to code in C# and C++ with SplashKit. Ensure that you have WSL installed and configured on your Windows machine.

:::note[Already have SplashKit installed?]
If you have previously installed SplashKit (before 2024):

- Update SplashKit using your WSL terminal with the command: skm update
- Then you can skip to Step [3. Install SplashKit Globally](#3-install-splashkit-globally).
:::
Now, let's get started:

Now, to set up WSL and install SplashKit on Windows, follow the steps outlined below:

## 1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

To install WSL on your Windows computer, follow the official Microsoft documentation: [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

Make sure to choose the WSL version that suits your needs (WSL 1 or WSL 2) and follow the instructions provided.

## 2. Install the SplashKit SDK

To install SplashKit on WSL, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Open your WSL Terminal

Open your WSL Terminal by searching for "WSL" in the Windows Start menu and selecting the appropriate WSL distribution.

### Step 2: Update package lists

Update the package lists in your WSL Terminal by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

This ensures that you have the latest information about available packages.

### Step 3: Install Git

`Git` and `Curl` is required to download the SplashKit installer. Install it by running the following command:

```bash title="Git & Curl installation script"
sudo apt install git curl
```

### Step 4: Download and run the SplashKit installer

Copy and paste the following command into your WSL Terminal to download and run the SplashKit installer:

```bash title="SKM installation script"
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
```

:::note
If the command above does not produce any response, ensure that your computer is connected to the internet and try disabling your firewall.

If you still encounter issues, you can download the install script locally by right-clicking on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh) and selecting "Save Link As." Then, navigate to the folder where you saved the file in Git Bash and run the command:

```bash title="SKM Installation script"
bash skm-install.sh
```

### Step 5: Install .NET SDK for C#

For coding in C#, you will need to install the .NET SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the .NET SDK for Linux from the official .NET website: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)
2. Open your WSL Terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the SDK.
3. Install the SDK by running the following command:

```bash title="Dotnet Installation script"
# Get Ubuntu version
declare repo_version=$(if command -v lsb_release &> /dev/null; then lsb_release -r -s; else grep -oP '(?<=^VERSION_ID=).+' /etc/os-release | tr -d '"'; fi)

# Download Microsoft signing key and repository
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$repo_version/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Install Microsoft signing key and repository
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Clean up
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Update packages
sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the actual version you wish to download. Example: `sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0`

### Step 6: Install C/C++ Tools

For coding in C++, you will need a C++ compiler and debugger. WSL comes with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and GDB (GNU Debugger) by default. Ensure they are installed by running the following command:

```bash title="C++ Installation script"
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install gdb
```

These commands will install the necessary C/C++ compilers and debuggers for your development environment.

## 3. Install SplashKit Globally

To install SplashKit globally on your WSL, run the following command in your WSL Terminal:
![](/public/gifs/setup-windows/wsl-install-global.gif)

```bash title="Splashkit Installation script"
skm linux install
skm global install
```

This command will add the SplashKit libraries and include files into the appropriate directories.

## 4. Install Visual Studio Code

After installing MSYS, proceed to set up Visual Studio Code:

#### Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio Code

1. Visit the Visual Studio Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. Download the Windows Installer (.exe) file.
3. Run the installer, following on-screen instructions.
4. Customize installation options as needed.
5. Open Visual Studio Code from the Start menu.

## 5. Install VSCode Extensions

Open Visual Studio Code and install these extensions for a better development experience:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="C/C++">
    **C/C++**: Install the "C/C++" extension for C++ development.
    ![](/images/windows-setup/c++-extensions.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="C#">
    **C#**: Install the "C#" extension for .NET development.
    ![](/images/windows-setup/csharp-extensions.png)
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Now, your Windows machine is set up with WSL, Visual Studio Code, and SplashKit, ready for C++ and C# development. Happy coding!
