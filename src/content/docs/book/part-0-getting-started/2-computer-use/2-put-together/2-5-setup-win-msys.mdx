### 4. Install Language Tools for C++ and C#

#### For C++

Ensure you have the necessary tools by running these commands in MSYS terminal:

#### For C# (.NET SDK)

1. Download the latest .NET SDK for Windows from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Run the installer and follow on-screen instructions.

### 5. Install VSCode Extensions

Open Visual Studio Code and install these extensions for a better development experience:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="C/C++">
    **C/C++**: Install the "C/C++" extension for C++ development.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="C#">
    **C#**: Install the "C#" extension for .NET development.
    ![](/images/windows-setup/csharp-extensions.png)
  </TabItem>
  Now, your Windows machine is set up with MSYS, Visual Studio Code, and
  SplashKit, ready for C++ and C# development. Happy coding!

## 6. Testing SplashKit Install

To test your SplashKit installation on WSL, run the following command in your WSL Terminal:

```bash
skm test
```

This will ensure that SplashKit is correctly installed and working on your WSL environment.

With these steps completed, you have set up your Windows computer for coding in C# and C++ with SplashKit using WSL. Happy coding!
