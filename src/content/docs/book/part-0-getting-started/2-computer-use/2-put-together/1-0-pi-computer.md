    Build your own Multi-tool!
---

Building programs really requires that you have access to a computer that you can play around with. To maximise your experience, we have designed things to work with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) single board computer.

Using the multi-tool will give you several advantages:

- You can play around with unix without risking your day-to-day computer (which you can switch to Linux once you are more confident)
- The Raspberry Pi include pins for **General Purpose Input / Output** (**GPIO**) though a [40-pin header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header) on the board. We can use this to interact with electronics and see how we can control things in the real world using code.
- Playing with a Raspberry Pi is just more fun üòÅ.

*Where do you get one of these multi-tools?*

You don't. You *build it yourself*.

The next couple of pages will go over how to build and configure the multi-tool. You can then use this for the activities in this guide. We will first look at the hardware you need, and where you can get it, and then we can look at the software you need and how you can install that using the [Terminal](../../1-concepts/01-terminal) on your Pi.

Let's get going...

## Alternatives

Not sure if you want the hardware, but still want to set something like this up? There are some alternatives.

Rather than getting a new physical machine, you can download virtual machine software and follow the software setup to get it working in there.

## Hardware

There are many hardware and component choices you can make building your Raspberry Pi multi-tool. Our selection is a self-contained unit using off-the-shelf parts that can run off a battery. Depending on your needs, you may forgo some choices, like the battery or the display.
