**TODO: Update**

<!-- Update to match other wrap up file formats and test code -->
<!-- possibly also add reminder tip about compiling and running commands -->

<!-- The following shows the code for the guessing game. Make sure to have a go at implementing this yourself, but you can use this for parts if you get stuck. -->

<!-- add final Hello World program code after put together is done -->
```cpp

```
