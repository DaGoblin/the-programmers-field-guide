**TODO: Update**

<!-- Update to match chapter 2 (add steps with more detail and much less code (only small snippets) and relate back to concepts) -->
<!-- might split into multiple files -->
<!-- check concepts of this chapter and previous part -->

## C++ Hello World Program

<!-- TODO: Add preamble -->

Content coming soon....

### 1. Create C++ program folder

<!-- TODO: Add text about using Code folder etc -->

```zsh
cd ~/Documents/Code
mkdir HelloWorldCPP
cd HelloWorldCPP
```

### 2. Create new C++ code file

<!-- TODO: Add text about using touch and code . -->

```zsh
touch program.cpp
code .
```

### 3. Compile your program

Open `program.cpp` file by double-clicking the file in the Explorer tab:

<!-- TODO: Add image showing files in Explorer tab -->

<!-- TODO: Add note about main (and that C++ is in Part 2, so don't worry about understanding everything now) -->

Copy the following code into the `main` function, in your program.cpp file:

```cpp
write_line("Coming soon... haha");
```
<!-- TODO: Add proper terminal-based code for testing -->

<!-- TODO: Add text leading into next page -->
