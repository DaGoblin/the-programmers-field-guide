**TODO: Update**

<!-- Update to match chapter 2 (add more detail and relate back to concepts) -->

As you have seen, the syntax for the statements within your code are almost exactly the same. Have a bit of a practice with this by reimplementing some of your earlier C# programs.

This process can be fairly mechanical:

- Copy your code over.
- Wrap the logic within `int main() {...}`.
- Adjust the includes at the start.
- Adjust SphaskKit identifier names and ReadLine/Write/WriteLine - from PascalCase to snake_case.
- Change conversion method to their C/C++ function equivalents.
- Rename any variables from camelCase to snake_case.

<!-- possibly move this tip into hello-world file -->
:::tip
Right-click on the variables you want to rename and choose **Rename Symbol** - vscode will then search and replace this within your project!
